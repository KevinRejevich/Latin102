Option B:

Compare a passage of Hyginus with an illutration of the same subject in art.
Identify the work of art, and cite at least two specific points in Hyginusâ€™ Latin that are similar to or different from the visual illustration.

Hyginus chapter 30, section 1:  >Infans cum esset, dracones duos duabus manibus necauit, quos Iuno miserat, unde primigenius est dictus. 

>>> This work of art, denoted as *Capitoline Museum, Inv. Scu. 247*, is illustrating baby Hercules strangling the two snakes which Juno had sent.
-The sculpture shows 2 snake being strangled by baby Hercules which is one point of similarity between the text and the sculpture.
Another specfic point that is similar between the latin text and the sculpture of baby Hercules is that Hercules is using both hands to strangle the two snakes
denoted in the text using 'duabus manibus' in the ablative case (ablative of agent). Another obvious similarity is that the sculpture and text both illustrate an infant male person denoted as Hercules. One point of contrast bewteen the text and scultpture is that the sculpture does not depict Juno, the one that sent the snakes to attack Hercules, but the text does.
