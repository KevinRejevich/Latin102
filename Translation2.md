B. Grammatical questions
Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)
The antecedent of cui is 'flumen magnum' which is accusative, singular, neuter. cui ,however, is dative, singluar, masculine drescribing the river which Dianira crossed. There is no other dative antecedent so I'm not sure why this was marked wrong...?
It fucntions in the sentence as a relative prounoun describing the river previosuly mentioned which the wife of Hercules crossed.


Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.
  Present Active Infinitive. It is placed in the phrase of my choosing becuase it complements the main verb 'non poterat'.
   
sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense voice).

William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424.
In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle.
Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.

'moriens'

C. Translation 
         "Deianira, the wife of Hercules, was not able to cross the large river, of which Evenus was the name,
    and she asked the help of Nessus the Centaur who was the son of Iuxoris and Nubis. This Centaur wished
   to rape Deianira who was lifted up in the river itself. To this place, Hercules fastened Nessus with
   arrows when he intervened and when Deinira implored the protection of him (Hercules). 
   That (centaur) dying gave his own blood to Deinira who was saved and he said that this is the potion when he knew that the large 
   arrows soaked with the poison of the Hydra Lernae to have potency."
