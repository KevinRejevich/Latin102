B. Grammatical questions
Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)
The antecedent of cui is flumen which is accusative, singular, neuter and cui must be accusative, singluar, neuter.
It fucntions in the sentence as a relative prounoun describing the river previosuly mentioned. Cui is in this case becuase it has to match the antecedent it modifies.

  Present Active Infinitive. It is placed in the phrase of my choosing becuase it complements the main verb 'non poterat'.

William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424.
In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle.

'Ut depono moriens'

C. Translation 
         "Deianira, the wife of Hercules, was not able to cross the large river, to which Evenus was the name,
    and she asked the help of Nessus the Centaur who was the son of Iuxoris and Nubis. This Centaur wished
   to rape Deianira who had been lifted up in the river itself. To this place, Hercules fastened Nessus with
   arrows when he might have intervened and when Deinira might have implored the protection of him (Hercules). 
   That (centaur) dying gave his own blood to Deinira who was saved and that this is the potion when he knew that the large 
   arrows which were soaked with the poison of the Hydra Lernae to have potency."
