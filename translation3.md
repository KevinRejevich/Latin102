C. Literary commentary
Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content.
Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences.
Italicize Latin words when citing them.
>>-He omitted certain subjects with verbs such as *adduxit* which made it easier to read without repeating the same subject many times. This is a technique of diction
that allows readers to more easily read the passage keeping a better flow of different vocabulary. (Diction)
>>>- He purposely chose to you two subjects in the first sentence, *stercus bobile*,to show and emphasize the vile imagery of the bathroom. This connection
     of two vile nouns, *stercus bobile*, with a verb of cleanliness illustrates a juxtaposed image describing the King who normally isn't associated with filth.
