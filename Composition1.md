Revising your composition
Some common questions that came up in work on composition 1:

to. When the English preposition “to” expresses the indirect object, Latin uses the dative case by itself. If you want to express (sending something, travelling) “to a person”, use the Latin preposition ad. And one gotcha to note: to travel to a city, Latin uses the accusative alone! volo Roman ire, “I want to go to Rome.”
since. The English conjunction “since” has a variety of shades of meaning. In Latin, quia refers to a causal connection between its dependent clause and the clause it connects to. In this composition, I think you want to emphasize the circumstances connecting the indepedent clause: don’t forget that “since” can be a perfectly good translation of Latin cum with the subjunctive!
temporal clauses. If you’re uncertain about what mood and tense you should choose for a temporal clause, refer to this flow chart .
indirect statement. When you’re composing indirect statemens, check that:
you use an infinitive form of the verb
you use the accusative case for the subject
if the subject is the same as the subject of main verb, remember to use the reflexive pronoun se rather than a form of is, ea, id.
if you are using a perfect passive infinitive or a future active infinitive, remember that since those compound infinitive forms are using the infinitive esse with an adjective, the adjective must agree in gender and number with the accusative subject of the infinitive.
Greek names. Like Latin, Greek nouns had cases, so Latin speakers often just used Greek nouns in their Greek form! Iole is one of those names: her nominative is Iole, her Greek accusative is Iolen; if you need to refer to her in another case in your composition, you should use a good Latin pronoun that you already know!

Background story
(Based on chapter 35 of Hyginus)

Heracles travelled to the city of Oechalia in Aetolia, and asked the king, Eurytus, for permission to marry his daughter, Iole. When Eurytus refused, Heracles not only destroyed the city, but killed Iole’s parents before her very eyes. He then took Iole captive, and sent her to his home, to his wife Deianira (!)

Instructions
Using the story above as inspiration, compose a paragraph of Latin according to the instructions below. (DO NOT DIRECTLY TRANSLATE THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE.)

Your composition should use all the vocabulary items listed below at least once.
Your first sentence should use a temporal clause to express that when Hercules came to Oechalia, he asked to marry Iole.
Your second sentence should state that when her father Eurytus was unwilling, Hercules captured Oechalia.
Your third sentence should express that Hercules said that he would kill her parents, and should include an indirect statement.
Your fourth sentence should say that Iole endured that her parents were killed.
Your fifth statement should say that when he had killed all of them, he sent Iole to Deianira.
Notes
Iole is a Greek name, and Hyginus uses the Greek form of her name in the accusative, Iolen.
